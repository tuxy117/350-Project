We are Cub Scouts and are selling popcorn to raise funds for our activities! <br />
Please help us follow our motto, which is "Do Your Best!" <br />
Webelos (pronounced WE-buh-lows) means "WE'll BE LOyal Scouts!" <br />
Our promise is "I, (name), promise to do my best, to do my duty to God and my country, to help other people, and to obey the Law of the Pack." <br />
The Law of the Pack is "The cub scout follows Akela, the cub scout helps the pack go, the pack helps the cub scout grow, the cub scout gives goodwill." <br />
Akela (pronounced Ah-KAY-la) means good leader. That is usually one or both of our parents. <br />
Again, please help us with our fundraiser! <br /> Thanks from the Cub Scouts! </font>
