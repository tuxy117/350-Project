	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>We are Cub Scouts and are selling popcorn to raise funds for our activities! </p>
	<p>Please help us follow our motto, which is "Do Your Best!"</p>
	<p>Webelos (pronounced	WE-buh-lows) means "WE'll BE LOyal Scouts!"</p>
	<p>Our promise is "I, (name), promise to do my best, to do my duty to God and my country, 
	to help other people, </p> <p>and to obey the Law of the Pack."</p>
	<p>The Law of the Pack is "The cub scout follows Akela, the cub scout helps the pack go, 
	the pack helps the cub scout grow, </p> <p>the cub scout gives goodwill."</p>
	<p>Akela (pronounced Ah-KAY-la) means good leader.	That is usually one or both	of our parents.</p>  
	<p>Again, please help us with our fundraiser!</p>  
	<p>Thanks from the Cub Scouts!</p>
